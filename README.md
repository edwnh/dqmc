# Determinantal quantum Monte Carlo for the Hubbard model

## Environment and dependencies

Linux is the only supported OS at this moment. macOS and Windows support will be implemented soon.

### Build dependencies
- Intel compiler `icx`
- Intel MKL headers and libraries
- HDF5 headers and libraries

### Runtime dependencies
- None. The MKL and HDF5 libraries are statically linked by default.

### Python packages (for scripts in `util/`)
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `h5py`

On a local computer: install conda (anaconda, miniconda, or micromamba) and set up a new environment using `environment.yml`. You can probably follow the instructions below for the GitHub Codespace.

On a cluster: you may have HDF5, Intel compilers and MKL, and Python packages available in your cluster's modules. Modify the variables `MKLROOT` and `HDF_PREFIX` in `Makefile` accordingly. You might also need to switch to dynamic linking. Alternatively, compile a binary locally or in a codespace and upload the binary to the cluster.

## Example using GitHub Codespaces

The easiest way to try the code is to create a GitHub Codespaces with this repository. In the terminal of a codespace,

1.  First, initialize conda.
    ```bash
    conda init
    ```
    Close (Ctrl+D) and reopen the terminal (Ctrl+`).
2.  Create a new conda environment according to environment.yml.
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    Wait for all the packages to download and install. This might take a few minutes. Then activate the new environment named `dqmc`.
    ```bash
    conda activate dqmc
    ```
3.  Download and extract the latest release of HDF5.
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/releases/download/hdf5_1.14.5/hdf5-1.14.5-ubuntu-2404_gcc.tar.gz
    tar xf hdf5-1.14.5-ubuntu-2404_gcc.tar.gz
    tar xf hdf5/HDF5-1.14.5-Linux.tar.gz
    rm -r hdf5 hdf5-1.14.5-ubuntu-2404_gcc.tar.gz
    ```
4.  Now the environment is ready for compiling and running the code.
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    The binary is located at build/dqmc.

## Usage

1. First, pick whether to compile with `-DUSE_CPLX`. Real DQMC uses 8 byte`double`, and can only be used with hdf5 files generated with `nflux=0` option, while Complex DQMC uses 16 byte `complex double`, and can only be used with hdf5 files generated with `nflux!=0` option.
2. Generate simulation files using `gen_1band_hub.py` or a similar script. Parameters can be passed through the command line. A list of parameters and their default values can be found in the function definitions of `create_1` and `create_batch` in `util/gen_1band_hub.py`.
3. Perform the Monte Carlo sweeps using the `dqmc` binary
    1. Single file mode usage: `./build/dqmc_1 [-b] [-l log_file.log] [-s interval] [-t max_time] sim_file.h5`.
        * `-b`: Benchmark mode, data is not saved.
        * `-l log_file.log`: Write output to log_file.log instead of stdout.
        * `-s interval`: Saves a checkpoint every interval seconds.
        * `-t max_time`: Run for a maximum of max_time seconds. Saves a checkpoint if simulation does not complete.
4. Analyze the data using the scripts in `util/`. Typically this is done inside Jupyter notebooks.

## Details

### Simulation files

One Markov chain = one HDF5 file. A file contains the following groups:
* metadata: Miscellaneous information and parameters not used during the simulation, but possibly useful in data analysis. Examples: name of the model, Hamiltonian parameters, temperature.
* params: Simulation parameters and pre-calculated matrices used in the simulation. Examples: kinetic energy matrix and its exponential, number of warmup and measurement sweeps. The data in this group may be stored in a separate HDF5 file, with extension .h5.params. This saves storage space since a batch of simulation files typically has identical params.
* state: Simulation state: sweep number, RNG state, auxiliary field configuration
* meas_eqlt: equal-time measurements
* meas_uneqlt: unequal-time measurements i.e. <O(tau) P>. This group exists only if unequal-time measurements are enabled.

### Simulation file generation

List of parameters
* `Nfiles`: Number of simulation files to generate. Each file is identical except for the RNG seed. Default: `Nfiles=1`.
* `prefix`: Prefix for the name of each simulation file. Default: `prefix="sim"`.
* `seed`: RNG seed. Default: RNG is initialized by `os.urandom()`.
* `overwrite`: Whether to overwrite existing files. Default: `False`.
* `Nx`, `Ny`: Rectangular cluster geometry. Default: `Nx=16 Ny=4`.
* `mu`: Chemical potential. Default: `mu=0`.
* `tp`: 2nd neighbor hopping. Default: `tp=0`.
* `U`: Hubbard interaction. Default: `U=6`.
* `dt`: Imaginary time discretization. Default: `dt=0.115`.
* `L`: Number of imaginary time steps. Default: `L=40`.
* `nflux`: Number of magnetic flux quanta perpendicular to the plane. Default: `nflux=0`.
* `n_delay`: Number of updates to group together in the delayed update scheme. Default: `n_delay=16`.
* `n_matmul`: Half the maximum number of direct matrix multiplications before applying a QR decomposition for stability. Default: `n_matmul=8`.
* `n_sweep_warm`: Number of warmup sweeps. Default: `n_sweep_warm=200`.
* `n_sweep_meas`: Number of measurement sweeps. Default: `n_sweep_meas=800`.
* `period_eqlt`: Period of equal-time measurements. 1 means equal-time measurements are performed `L` times per sweep. Default: `period_eqlt=8`.
* `period_uneqlt`: Period of unequal-time measurements. 1 means unequal-time measurements are performed once per sweep. 0 means disabled. Default: `period_uneqlt=0`.
* `meas_bond_corr`: Whether to measure bond-bond correlations (current, kinetic energy, bond singlets). Default: `meas_bond_corr=1`.
* `meas_energy_corr`: Whether to measure energy-energy correlations. Default: `meas_energy_corr=0`.
* `meas_nematic_corr`: Whether to measure spin and charge nematic correlations. Default: `meas_nematic_corr=0`.
* `trans_sym`: Whether to apply translational symmetry to compress measurement data. Default: `trans_sym=1`.
